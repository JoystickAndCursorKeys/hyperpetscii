# HYPERPETSCII

Check https://github.com/JoystickAndCursorKeys/hyperpetscii/wiki for more information.

HYPER PETSCII is an PETSCII editor with a twist. 
Instead of using a modern GUI to allow you to edit the PETSCII graphics, it takes you back in time, and gives you access only to a GUI made directly in the C64 graphics mode (right in the web browser).  (But with a dual monitor setup, something the C64 did not have).
